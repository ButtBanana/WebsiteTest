She was on the way to see her gay Will Snozcumber, when she decided to take a short cut through Greenton Woods.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&#39;t long before Chloe got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, George, but George was nowhere to be found! Chloe began to panic. She felt sure she had packed George. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unexpectedly, she saw a wise hamster dressed in a green waistcoat disappearing into the trees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;How odd!&quot; thought Chloe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed hamster. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, Chloe reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from turnips, a house made from biscuits, a house made from jelly babies, a house made from crisps, a house made from macarons and a house made from muffins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chloe could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Hello!&quot; she called. &quot;Is anybody there?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nobody replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chloe looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else&#39;s chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a </span><span class="c3 c7">whole</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A cackle broke through the air, giving Chloe a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was George!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;George!&quot; shouted Chloe. She turned to the witch. &quot;That&#39;s my toy!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The witch just shrugged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Give George back!&quot; cried Chloe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Not on your nelly!&quot; said the witch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;At least let George out of that cage!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before she could reply, five wise hamsters rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Chloe recognised the one in the green waistcoat that she&#39;d seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Hello Big Hamster,&quot; said the witch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Good morning.&quot; The hamster noticed George. &quot;Who is this?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s George,&quot; explained the witch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Ooh! George would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!&quot; demanded the hamster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The witch shook her head. &quot;George is staying with me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&quot;Um... Excuse me...&quot; Chloe interrupted. &quot;George lives with me! And </span><span class="c3 c7">not</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in a cage!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Big Hamster ignored her. &quot;Is there nothing you&#39;ll trade?&quot; he asked the witch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The witch thought for a moment, then said, &quot;I do like to be entertained. I&#39;ll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Big Hamster looked at the house made from muffins and said, &quot;No problem, I could eat an entire </span><span class="c3 c7">house</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;made from muffins if I wanted to.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&quot;That&#39;s nothing,&quot; said the next hamster. &quot;I could eat </span><span class="c3 c7">two</span><span class="c1">houses.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;There&#39;s no need to show off,&quot; said the witch. Just eat one front door and I&#39;ll let you have George.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chloe watched, feeling very worried. She didn&#39;t want the witch to give George to Big Hamster. She didn&#39;t think George would like living with a wise hamster, away from her house and all her other toys.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The other four hamsters watched while Big Hamster put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll eat this whole house,&quot; said Big Hamster. &quot;Just you watch!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Big Hamster pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from biscuits. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp;And more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, Big Hamster started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of biscuits, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Erm... I don&#39;t feel too good,&quot; said Big Hamster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, he started to roll. He&#39;d grown so round that he could no longer balance!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Help!&quot; he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Big Hamster never finished eating the front door made from biscuits and George remained trapped in the witch&#39;s cage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Average Hamster stepped up, and approached the house made from jelly babies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll eat this whole house,&quot; said Average Hamster. &quot;Just you watch!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Average Hamster pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from jelly babies. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp;And more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a while, Average Hamster started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp;...and greener.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A woodcutter walked into the clearing. &quot;What&#39;s this bush doing here?&quot; he asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not a bush, I&#39;m a hamster!&quot; said Average Hamster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;It talks!&quot; exclaimed the woodcutter. &quot;Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I&#39;d better take it away before somebody gets hurt.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;No! Wait!&quot; cried Average Hamster, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the hamster away under his arm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Average Hamster never finished eating the front door made from jelly babies and George remained trapped in the witch&#39;s cage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Little Hamster stepped up, and approached the house made from crisps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll eat this whole house,&quot; said Little Hamster. &quot;Just you watch!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Little Hamster pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from crisps. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp;And more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After five or six platefuls, Little Hamster started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He stopped eating crisps for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Hamster into the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Aggghhhhhh!&quot; cried Little Hamster. &quot;I&#39;m scared of heigh...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Little Hamster was never seen again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Little Hamster never finished eating the front door made from crisps and George remained trapped in the witch&#39;s cage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tiny Hamster stepped up, and approached the house made from macarons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll eat this whole house,&quot; said Tiny Hamster. &quot;Just you watch!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tiny Hamster pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from macarons. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp;And more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, on the next mouthful, the food fell straight out of Tiny Hamster&#39;s mouth. She tried to stuff in another forkful of macarons, but once again, the food fell out. There just wasn&#39;t enough room left in her belly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;This is just not fair!&quot; declared Tiny Hamster, and stomped off into the forest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tiny Hamster never finished eating the front door made from macarons and George remained trapped in the witch&#39;s cage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even-Tinier Hamster stepped up, and approached the house made from muffins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll eat this whole house,&quot; said Even-Tinier Hamster. &quot;Just you watch!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even-Tinier Hamster pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from muffins. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp;And more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, Even-Tinier Hamster stopped eating and started dancing. While he danced, he sang at the top of his lungs, &quot;Muffins! Watch me eat all the muffins!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;It looks as though the muffins are making you hyperactive,&quot; laughed the witch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh no they&#39;re not!&quot; cried Even-Tinier Hamster. &quot;I&#39;m always this excited.&quot; With that, he walked into a tree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c6">Bong!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even-Tinier Hamster banged his head and fell backwards onto his bottom. He passed out, exhausted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even-Tinier Hamster never finished eating the front door made from muffins and George remained trapped in the witch&#39;s cage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; said the witch. &quot;I win. I get to keep George.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Not so fast,&quot; said Chloe. &quot;There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from turnips. And I haven&#39;t had a turn yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t have to give you a turn!&quot; laughed the witch. &quot;My game. My rules.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The woodcutter&#39;s voice carried through the forest. &quot;I think you should give her a chance. It&#39;s only fair.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Fine,&quot; said the witch. &quot;But you saw what happened to the hamsters. She won&#39;t last long.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; said Chloe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;What?&quot; said the witch. &quot;Where&#39;s your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted George back.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chloe ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from turnips and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chloe sat down on a nearby log.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;You fail!&quot; cackled the witch. &quot;You were supposed to eat the whole door.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;I haven&#39;t finished,&quot; explained Chloe. &quot;I am just waiting for my food to go down.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Chloe&#39;s food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from turnips. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, after several sittings, Chloe was down to the final piece of the door made from turnips. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Chloe had eaten the entire front door of the house made from turnips.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The witch stamped her foot angrily. &quot;You must have tricked me!&quot; she said. &quot;I don&#39;t reward </span><span class="c3 c7">cheating</span><span class="c1">!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t think so!&quot; said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. &quot;This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over George or I will chop your broomstick in half.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chloe hurried over and grabbed George, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, George was unharmed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chloe thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Will. It was starting to get dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Chloe got to Will&#39;s house, her gay threw his arms around her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&quot;I was so worried!&quot; cried Will. &quot;You are </span><span class="c3 c7">very</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;late.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Chloe described her day, she could tell that Will didn&#39;t believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; asked Will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chloe unwrapped a doorknob made from biscuits. &quot;Pudding!&quot; she said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Will almost fell off his chair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The End</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c5"></span></p></body></html>
